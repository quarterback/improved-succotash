# What Occupant Can Learn from Stripe's Homepage
## Strategic Analysis for Post-Acquisition Positioning

**Context**: With State Capacity AI and Glowrm acquisitions pending, Occupant needs to broaden beyond model benchmarks to amplify advisory capabilities.

---

## Executive Summary

**Stripe's Core Pattern**: They lead with infrastructure, prove it with specificity, and segment by customer journey—not just by product features.

**Occupant's Opportunity**: You're positioned as "the CPI for AI" but selling "avoid expensive mistakes." Stripe shows how to bridge that gap: lead with the advisory value proposition, use the indices as credibility signals (not the hero), and create clear entry points for different institutional buyers.

**The Gap**: Occupant currently leads with data products (CPI/AEAI indices) and buries the advisory work. Stripe does the opposite—they lead with business outcomes ("grow your revenue") and use technical proof points as credibility signals downstream.

---

## 1. Value Proposition Hierarchy

### Stripe's Approach
- **Hero message**: "Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue"
  - Business outcome first (revenue growth)
  - Technical positioning second (infrastructure)
  - Universal applicability ("from your first transaction to your billionth")

- **Layered narrative**:
  1. Primary: What you get (revenue growth)
  2. Secondary: How it works (accept payments, enable services, custom models)
  3. Tertiary: Proof it works (Fortune 100, $1.4T processed, 99.999% uptime)

### Occupant's Current State
- **Hero message**: "The Standard for AI Compute Value"
  - Data positioning first (benchmarks)
  - Advisory value buried in section 3-4
  - Limited outcome specificity

### **Recommendation: Invert the Hierarchy**

**New hero**: "Advisory infrastructure to govern AI decisions"

**Subheading**: "Before you sign the contract. Before you deploy to production. Before you're locked into procurement choices you'll regret—we help institutions build decision architectures that hold up under scrutiny."

**Why this works**:
- Leads with the business problem (governance, procurement risk)
- Positions indices as *proof* rather than product
- Addresses the acquisitions: State Capacity AI + Glowrm expand your advisory toolkit, not just your model coverage
- Creates urgency (pre-procurement intervention)

---

## 2. Dual Audience Strategy (Technical + Commercial)

### Stripe's Execution
They explicitly split navigation:
- **For Developers**: API docs, SDKs, GitHub, technical metrics (10K requests/second)
- **For Business Leaders**: Revenue impact, compliance, Fortune 500 validation

Same homepage, different entry points. Technical users self-select into docs. Commercial users follow the "Contact sales" path.

### Occupant's Current Gap
You blend technical and commercial in a single narrative:
- Indices dominate the homepage (technical)
- Advisory services appear as add-ons (commercial)
- No clear segmentation for different decision-makers

### **Recommendation: Create Parallel Narratives**

**For Procurement & Policy Leaders** (Commercial Path):
- Hero: "Are you about to sign an AI contract you can't evaluate?"
- CTA: "Schedule a retainer consultation" or "Download procurement checklist"
- Proof: Case studies of avoided mistakes, $ saved, governance frameworks adopted
- Indices appear as *validation* ("Our benchmarks track 2,300+ models daily—we know what you're buying")

**For Analysts & Researchers** (Technical Path):
- Hero: "Public AI cost benchmarks, updated daily"
- CTA: "View CPI Dashboard" or "Access API"
- Proof: Methodology rigor, data sources, historical accuracy
- Advisory services appear as *escalation* ("Need help interpreting this for your budget? Talk to our team")

**Implementation**:
- Split homepage into two visual zones or create toggle (like Stripe's "Start now" vs "Contact sales")
- Use segmentation questions: "I'm here to: [ ] Evaluate a contract [ ] Analyze market trends"

---

## 3. Social Proof Specificity

### Stripe's Pattern
They don't say "trusted by enterprises"—they say:
- **Named companies**: Amazon, Shopify, Anthropic, OpenAI
- **Exact metrics**: $1.4T processed in 2024, 50% of Fortune 100
- **Use case quotes**: "Mindbody uses Stripe to..." with specific outcomes

### Occupant's Current Gap
Your social proof is methodological (2,300+ models, daily updates) but lacks:
- Client names (if permissible)
- Outcome metrics ($ saved, contracts revised, RFPs improved)
- Specific use cases

### **Recommendation: Build the Case Study Library**

**Post-acquisition positioning**:
- "We advised [State Government X] on a $40M AI procurement—saving 18 months of rework"
- "Our workshop with [Foundation Y] identified $2M in unbudgeted reasoning model costs before deployment"
- "Expert testimony helped [Federal Agency Z] revise their RFP to include reversibility clauses"

**If names can't be disclosed**:
- Use anonymized segments: "A Western state CIO", "A top-5 education foundation"
- Lead with outcomes: "Identified $2M budget gap before contract signing"
- Quote decision-makers (with permission): "The indices showed us our entire cost model was wrong"

**Where to place**:
- Hero section: "Organizations we've kept from expensive mistakes"
- Mid-page: Full case study cards (like Stripe's Hertz/URBN examples)
- Testimonials with photos/titles (builds trust)

---

## 4. Segmentation by Customer Journey

### Stripe's Execution
They create paths for:
- **Startups**: Stripe Startups (fast setup, credits, growth tools)
- **Enterprises**: Custom pricing, compliance, dedicated support
- **Platforms**: Marketplace features, Connect API
- **Developers**: Docs-first experience

Same product, different narratives per segment.

### Occupant's Opportunity
You have natural segments but don't articulate them:

**Segment 1: Emergency Procurement** (High urgency, pre-signature)
- "You're signing in 30 days and can't evaluate the vendor's claims"
- Offering: Rapid vendor assessment, contract redlines, risk analysis
- CTA: "Emergency consultation (48hr turnaround)"

**Segment 2: Strategic Planning** (Lower urgency, building governance)
- "You're building AI strategy for 2027 and need decision frameworks"
- Offering: Retainer advisory, quarterly workshops, governance design
- CTA: "Schedule a scoping call"

**Segment 3: Vendor Positioning** (Reverse buyers—vendors selling to govt)
- "You're responding to RFPs that demand responsible AI proof"
- Offering: Expert testimony, methodology audits, credibility signals
- CTA: "Discuss partnership terms"

**Segment 4: Research/Policy** (Non-commercial, public good)
- "You're writing policy and need ground truth on AI economics"
- Offering: Data access, briefings, co-authored reports
- CTA: "Access public data" or "Request a briefing"

### **Implementation**:
Create segment-specific landing sections or pages. Use Stripe's card-based approach:

```
[Card 1: Emergency Procurement]
Headline: "Contract signature in 30 days?"
Subhead: "Rapid vendor assessment before you're locked in"
CTA: "Get emergency consultation →"

[Card 2: Strategic Advisory]
Headline: "Building AI governance for the long term?"
Subhead: "Embedded retainers for institutional buyers"
CTA: "Explore retainer terms →"

[Card 3: Vendor Services]
Headline: "Winning RFPs that demand AI credibility?"
Subhead: "Expert testimony and methodology audits"
CTA: "Partner with us →"
```

---

## 5. Technical Credibility Without Technical Dominance

### Stripe's Balance
- **Technical proof is present but subordinate**:
  - API metrics appear mid-page, not hero
  - Developer navigation is separate, not default
  - Code examples exist but don't dominate

- **Business leaders see**: Revenue growth, compliance, customer success
- **Developers see**: Same page but self-select into technical depth

### Occupant's Current Imbalance
- **Homepage is indices-first** (lines 66-84: CPI/AEAI live values dominate)
- **Advisory appears at line 86** (after indices are already hero)
- **Result**: Visitors think you sell data products, not advisory services

### **Recommendation: Relegate Indices to Credibility Tier**

**Current structure**:
1. Hero: "The Standard for AI Compute Value"
2. Live indices (CPI, AEAI)
3. Advisory CTA (buried)

**Proposed structure** (Stripe-style):
1. **Hero**: "Advisory infrastructure to govern AI decisions"
   - "We help institutions avoid expensive AI mistakes before they're locked into contracts they'll regret"

2. **Proof tier** (replaces current live indices):
   - "Our team tracks 2,300+ models daily across CPI, AEAI, and market intelligence"
   - "The indices prove we understand the terrain. The advisory work keeps you from making decisions you can't reverse."
   - CTA: "View live benchmarks →" (moves indices to secondary path)

3. **Services tier** (expanded):
   - Advisory retainers
   - Workshops & briefings
   - Expert testimony
   - Each with use case specificity

4. **Social proof tier**:
   - Case studies (anonymized if needed)
   - Outcome metrics
   - Client quotes

5. **Public research tier** (current position maintained):
   - Free indices, calculators, tools
   - "The research that proves we understand AI economics"

---

## 6. The "Growth Story" Narrative

### Stripe's Pattern
"From your first transaction to your billionth"

This does three things:
1. **Inclusive entry**: Startups can begin immediately
2. **Aspirational scale**: Enterprises see long-term partnership
3. **Continuous relevance**: You don't outgrow the platform

### Occupant's Opportunity
**Current**: No growth story—services appear static

**Proposed**: "From your first RFP to your institutional governance framework"

**Implementation**:
- **Entry**: "Emergency procurement assessment" (one-time, low commitment)
- **Mid**: "Quarterly workshops and retainer advisory" (ongoing relationship)
- **Advanced**: "Embedded governance design" (institutional transformation)

**Why this matters post-acquisition**:
- State Capacity AI + Glowrm = more advisory depth (not just model coverage)
- You can now offer end-to-end governance, not just cost analysis
- Growth story positions you as long-term infrastructure, not one-off consulting

---

## 7. Emerging Trends & Future Positioning

### Stripe's Move
They prominently feature:
- "Agentic commerce" (emerging business model)
- Crypto payments (emerging tech)
- AI platform integrations (Anthropic, OpenAI partnerships)

**Message**: "We're not just payment infrastructure for today—we're infrastructure for *emerging* business models"

### Occupant's Parallel
**Current**: Indices track *current* AI costs (CPI, AEAI)

**Opportunity**: Position as infrastructure for *emerging* AI governance challenges

**Post-acquisition narrative**:
- "State Capacity AI acquisition: We now advise on agentic government services"
- "Glowrm acquisition: We now track AI reliability and decision-quality metrics, not just costs"
- "Expanded mandate: From cost benchmarks to full governance infrastructure"

**Homepage treatment**:
Add a "What's Next" or "Emerging Challenges" section:

```
[Section: Emerging AI Governance Challenges]

"The AI you're deploying in 2026 won't behave like the AI you budgeted for in 2025.
Reasoning models aren't deflating. Agentic systems are consuming 60-140% more tokens
per task. Governance frameworks written for 2024-era models are already obsolete.

With State Capacity AI and Glowrm, we're expanding beyond cost benchmarks to
full-spectrum advisory: decision quality, reversibility, institutional risk."

CTA: "Read our latest thinking →" [links to reports]
```

**Why this works**:
- Positions acquisitions as strategic evolution, not feature add-ons
- Aligns with Stripe's pattern (infrastructure for emerging models)
- Creates urgency (your current governance is already outdated)

---

## 8. Content as Conversion Path

### Stripe's Approach
They don't hard-sell—they educate:
- News carousel (recent launches)
- Events (Stripe Sessions)
- Research reports (vertical SaaS benchmarking)

Content serves dual purpose:
1. **SEO/thought leadership** (inbound)
2. **Lead nurturing** (outbound)

### Occupant's Current State
You publish excellent research (January 2026 report, for example) but it's not prominently featured on homepage.

### **Recommendation: Elevate Research as Lead Gen**

**Create "Latest Thinking" section** (Stripe-style news carousel):

```
[Latest Research]
→ "The Cognitive Floor: Why Reasoning Models Aren't Deflating" (Jan 2026)
→ "Autonomy Overhead: The Hidden Tax on Agent Architectures"
→ "State Capacity AI Integration: Governing Agentic Services"

CTA: "Subscribe to quarterly reports"
```

**Why this works**:
- Demonstrates ongoing expertise (not static benchmarks)
- Creates email capture path (lead gen)
- Positions you as thought leaders on emerging problems
- Supports advisory sales (clients read reports → book consultations)

**Post-acquisition content themes**:
- "How State Capacity AI changes government service delivery"
- "Glowrm reliability metrics: What they reveal about model stability"
- "Beyond CPI: Why cost deflation doesn't equal governance simplicity"

---

## 9. Call-to-Action Architecture

### Stripe's Dual CTA Pattern
Every section has two paths:
- **High intent**: "Contact sales" (enterprise)
- **Low intent**: "Start now" (self-serve)

They repeat CTAs at:
- Hero (primary)
- Mid-page (after social proof)
- Footer (persistent)

### Occupant's Current CTA Pattern
- Single CTA type: "Email hello@occupant.ee"
- Appears in advisory section and footer
- No low-commitment entry point

### **Recommendation: Tiered CTA Strategy**

**High intent (ready to buy advisory)**:
- "Schedule consultation" (30min scoping call)
- "Request emergency assessment" (urgent procurement)

**Medium intent (exploring)**:
- "Download procurement checklist" (lead capture)
- "Watch 15min workshop preview" (builds trust)

**Low intent (browsing)**:
- "View CPI Dashboard" (self-serve data)
- "Subscribe to quarterly reports" (stay in touch)

**Placement**:
- Hero: High + Medium intent CTAs
- Mid-page (after services): High intent
- Footer: All three tiers

**Example hero treatment**:
```
[Hero Section]
Headline: "Advisory infrastructure to govern AI decisions"
Subhead: "Before you sign. Before you deploy. Before you're locked in."

[Button 1 - Primary]: "Schedule consultation →"
[Button 2 - Secondary]: "Download procurement checklist"
[Link below]: "Or explore our public benchmarks"
```

## 10. Visual & Structural Recommendations

### What Stripe Does Well Visually

1. **Modular card layout**: Services as distinct, scannable blocks
2. **High-quality imagery**: Abstract concepts made concrete (city views = scale)
3. **White space**: Not cluttered despite information density
4. **Consistent micro-interactions**: CTAs that respond, hover states

### Occupant's Visual Opportunity

**Current state**:
- Text-heavy (good for credibility, bad for scanning)
- Indices dominate visually (live values, subindices grid)
- Advisory sections lack visual distinction

**Recommendations**:

**1. Use card-based service layout** (like Stripe's product grid):
```
[Card Layout for Services]
┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│ Emergency       │ │ Strategic       │ │ Vendor          │
│ Procurement     │ │ Advisory        │ │ Services        │
│                 │ │                 │ │                 │
│ [Icon]          │ │ [Icon]          │ │ [Icon]          │
│ Brief desc...   │ │ Brief desc...   │ │ Brief desc...   │
│                 │ │                 │ │                 │
│ → Learn more    │ │ → Learn more    │ │ → Learn more    │
└─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

**2. Create visual hierarchy** for indices (downgrade from hero):
- Move live CPI/AEAI to sidebar widget or mid-page "credentials" section
- Make them *proof points* not *primary offering*

**3. Add outcome-driven imagery**:
- Government buildings (institutional buyers)
- Contract/signature visuals (procurement urgency)
- Network diagrams (governance architecture)
- NOT: Charts/graphs dominating (that's what you have now)

**4. Implement Stripe's "statistic blocks"** pattern:
```
[Social Proof Section]
┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
│ 2,300+       │ │ $40M         │ │ 18 months    │
│ Models       │ │ Procurement  │ │ Saved in     │
│ Tracked      │ │ Reviewed     │ │ Rework       │
└──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
```

**5. Use color strategically**:
- Current: Minimal accent use
- Stripe pattern: Brand color (purple/blue) for CTAs, accents on key metrics
- Recommendation: Use `var(--brand)` more prominently for:
  - Primary CTAs ("Schedule consultation")
  - Key outcome metrics ("$40M saved")
  - Section dividers (advisory vs research)

---

## 11. Post-Acquisition Integration Points

### How to Announce State Capacity AI + Glowrm

**Option 1: Hero Integration** (Stripe-style product launch)
```
[Banner above hero]
"NEW: State Capacity AI + Glowrm acquisitions expand our advisory infrastructure"
→ Read announcement
```

**Option 2: Dedicated Section** (mid-page, after services)
```
[Section: Expanded Capabilities]
Headline: "Beyond Benchmarks: Full-Spectrum AI Governance"

"With State Capacity AI and Glowrm, we're expanding from cost tracking
to comprehensive decision infrastructure:

→ Agentic service design (State Capacity AI)
→ Model reliability metrics (Glowrm)
→ Procurement advisory (Occupant core)

The result: End-to-end governance—from cost analysis to deployment oversight."

CTA: "Explore our expanded mandate →"
```

**Option 3: Capability Matrix** (what you couldn't do before, what you can now)
```
| Capability | Before | After Acquisitions |
|------------|--------|--------------------|
| Cost benchmarks | ✓ (CPI, AEAI) | ✓ Enhanced |
| Agentic governance | ✗ | ✓ State Capacity AI |
| Reliability tracking | ✗ | ✓ Glowrm |
| Procurement advisory | ✓ | ✓ Deepened |
```

## 12. Specific Copy Recommendations

### Current Hero
> "The Standard for AI Compute Value"
> "Real-time benchmarks for AI costs and market activity."

**Problem**:
- Positions as data provider, not advisor
- No urgency or pain point
- Doesn't mention State Capacity AI / Glowrm value

### Proposed Hero (Option 1: Urgency-Driven)
> **"Don't Sign That Contract Yet"**
>
> "We help government agencies, foundations, and vendors avoid expensive AI mistakes
> before they're locked into procurement decisions they'll regret. Advisory infrastructure
> backed by the most comprehensive AI cost and reliability data available."
>
> [Schedule Consultation] [Download Procurement Guide]

**Why this works**:
- Opens with urgency (contract signature imminent)
- Clarifies audience (govt, foundations, vendors)
- Outcome-focused (avoid mistakes, prevent regret)
- Indices are *supporting* ("backed by data"), not *primary*
- CTAs offer high/low commitment paths

### Proposed Hero (Option 2: Infrastructure-Focused, Stripe-style)
> **"Advisory Infrastructure for AI Governance"**
>
> "From emergency procurement assessments to embedded institutional advisory—we help
> organizations build decision architectures that hold up under scrutiny. Daily benchmarks
> across 2,300+ models prove we understand the terrain."
>
> [Start a Conversation] [View Our Research]

**Why this works**:
- Mirrors Stripe ("infrastructure to grow revenue" → "infrastructure for governance")
- Growth story implicit ("emergency" → "institutional")
- Benchmarks repositioned as *credibility* not *product*
- Broader than just cost (governance, decision quality)

### Proposed Hero (Option 3: Problem-Solution)
> **"You're Deploying AI Without Understanding the Risks"**
>
> "Reasoning models that aren't deflating. Agentic systems consuming 140% more tokens
> than budgeted. Governance frameworks obsolete before they're signed. We advise
> institutions navigating AI procurement in an era of institutional-grade complexity."
>
> [Talk to Our Team] [Read Latest Report]

**Why this works**:
- Leads with specific, current problems (from your January 2026 report)
- Demonstrates domain expertise immediately
- Creates anxiety (good for B2B sales—you're selling risk mitigation)
- Research CTA builds credibility for those not ready to buy

---

### Current Advisory Section
> "About to sign an AI contract you can't evaluate?"
> "We help institutions avoid expensive mistakes before they're locked in."

**Problem**:
- Good copy, but buried at line 86 (after indices dominate)
- Single CTA (email)
- No segmentation

### Proposed Advisory Section (Expanded, Stripe-style)
```
[Section Headline]
"How We Help"

[Subheading]
"Advisory services for institutional AI buyers—from emergency procurement
to long-term governance design."

[Card 1: Emergency Procurement]
Icon: [Clock/Alert]
Headline: "Contract Signature in 30 Days?"
Body: "Rapid vendor assessment, contract redlines, and risk analysis.
We've reviewed $40M+ in AI procurement and saved clients 18 months
of rework."
CTA: "Request Emergency Assessment →"

[Card 2: Strategic Retainers]
Icon: [Building/Governance]
Headline: "Building Long-Term AI Governance?"
Body: "Embedded advisory for CIOs, foundation executives, and policy
teams. Quarterly workshops, decision architecture design, and ongoing
procurement support."
CTA: "Explore Retainer Terms →"

[Card 3: Vendor Credibility]
Icon: [Badge/Shield]
Headline: "Winning RFPs That Demand Responsible AI?"
Body: "Expert testimony, methodology audits, and credibility signals
for vendors selling to government. Partner with the team that defines
the standards."
CTA: "Discuss Partnership →"

[Below cards]
"What you're buying: Insurance against future harm. We help you avoid
expensive mistakes with AI before you're locked into contracts you'll
regret in 18 months."
```

---

## 13. Navigation Restructure

### Current Navigation
```
Index | CPI Data | AEAI | Market Intel | Calculator | Gov Benchmarks | About
```

**Problem**:
- All navigation is data/tool-focused
- No advisory entry point
- Doesn't reflect post-acquisition breadth

### Proposed Navigation (Stripe-style segmentation)
```
Solutions | Research | Resources | About | [CTA: Talk to Us]
```

**Breakdown**:

**Solutions** (dropdown):
- Advisory Services
  - Emergency Procurement
  - Strategic Retainers
  - Vendor Services
- Government Benchmarks
- Custom Research

**Research** (dropdown):
- Compute CPI
- AI Activity Index (AEAI)
- Market Intelligence
- Latest Reports

**Resources** (dropdown):
- Cost Calculator
- Procurement Checklist (new, lead capture)
- Methodology
- Case Studies (new)

**About** (dropdown):
- Who We Are
- Team (new, post-acquisition—introduce State Capacity AI / Glowrm leads)
- Contact
- Tardigrade Disclosure

**[Talk to Us]** (button, persistent):
- Primary CTA always visible
- Opens scheduling page or email

**Why this works**:
- **Solutions-first** (not data-first)
- Segmentation matches buyer journey (Solutions = buying, Research = exploring, Resources = self-serve)
- Persistent CTA (Stripe pattern)
- Room to grow (State Capacity AI / Glowrm can add their own sub-pages)

---

## 14. Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Before Acquisitions Announce)
1. **Restructure homepage hierarchy**:
   - Move advisory services to hero/section 1
   - Relegate indices to credibility tier (section 3-4)
   - Add tiered CTAs (consultation, checklist, research)

2. **Build case study library**:
   - 3-5 anonymized success stories
   - Outcome metrics ($X saved, Y months avoided)
   - Quote clients (with permission)

3. **Create lead capture tools**:
   - "AI Procurement Checklist" (downloadable, email gate)
   - "15-Minute Workshop Preview" (video, builds trust)
   - "Quarterly Report Subscription" (nurture path)

4. **Redesign navigation**:
   - Solutions > Research > Resources > About
   - Persistent "Talk to Us" CTA
   - Mobile-friendly (Stripe is excellent here)

### Phase 2: Acquisition Announcement
1. **Hero banner**:
   - "State Capacity AI + Glowrm acquisitions expand our governance infrastructure"
   - Link to dedicated announcement page

2. **New "Capabilities" section**:
   - Before/after matrix
   - What each acquisition enables
   - How they integrate with Occupant core

3. **Team page**:
   - Introduce State Capacity AI and Glowrm leadership
   - Combined expertise narrative
   - "Why we're stronger together" story

### Phase 3: Post-Launch Optimization
1. **A/B test hero messaging**:
   - Test 3 hero options (urgency, infrastructure, problem-solution)
   - Measure consultation request rate

2. **Content marketing escalation**:
   - Monthly reports (not just quarterly)
   - Webinar series on procurement risks
   - Guest posts on GovTech, FedScoop, etc.

3. **SEO optimization**:
   - Target keywords: "AI procurement advisory," "government AI contracts," "AI governance consulting"
   - Build backlinks from case studies, speaking engagements

---

## Conclusion: The Strategic Reframe

**Stripe's lesson for Occupant**:
> Don't lead with what you *have* (benchmarks, indices, data).
> Lead with what customers *get* (avoided mistakes, governance confidence, institutional resilience).

**Your current site says**: "We track AI costs really well—also, we do advisory."

**Stripe-inspired site would say**: "We help institutions govern AI—and our cost tracking proves we understand what you're buying."

**Post-acquisition opportunity**:
- State Capacity AI = governance infrastructure for agentic services
- Glowrm = reliability/quality metrics beyond just cost
- Occupant core = procurement and cost expertise

**Together**: "Full-spectrum AI governance advisory—from cost to capability to institutional risk"

**The new homepage tells that story**. The indices become proof, not product. The advisory services become infrastructure, not consulting. And your acquisitions become strategic depth, not feature add-ons.

---

**Next Action**: Schedule a homepage redesign workshop to implement these patterns before acquisition announcement goes public. Use this document as the brief.
